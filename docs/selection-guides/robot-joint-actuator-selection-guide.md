# Robot Joint Actuator Selection Guide

## Purpose of This Guide

A robot joint actuator should be selected from the complete axis requirement, not from one torque value or a product-family label. The joint position, payload, link geometry, acceleration, external forces, duty cycle, installation envelope, bearing loads, feedback architecture and controller limits all affect the final choice.

This guide provides a practical screening workflow for humanoid robots, quadruped robots, robotic arms, exoskeletons and other rotary-axis systems. Final model approval requires engineering review and prototype validation.

## Step 1: Define the Joint and Mechanism

Prepare a separate requirement sheet for each axis. A shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee or ankle normally has a different load case, motion profile and installation limit.

Record:

- Joint or axis position
- Payload and moving-link mass
- Link lengths
- Center-of-gravity locations
- Joint angle range
- External process forces
- Mechanical stops and collision loads
- Whether the axis is horizontal, vertical or gravity loaded
- Customer-side bearings, belts, pulleys, gears or linkages

Do not apply one actuator specification to every axis of the robot.

## Step 2: Estimate Output Torque

### Gravity Torque

For an initial one-axis estimate, gravity torque may be approximated by:

`T_gravity = m × g × r × sin(theta)`

where:

- `m` is the supported mass
- `g` is gravitational acceleration
- `r` is the distance from the joint axis to the center of gravity
- `theta` describes the mechanism orientation relative to gravity

The worst posture may not be the robot's normal operating posture, so review the full joint-angle range.

### Acceleration Torque

The torque required to accelerate the reflected inertia may be estimated by:

`T_acceleration = J × alpha`

where:

- `J` is the total inertia reflected to the joint output
- `alpha` is angular acceleration

Include the payload, links, tooling and any other moving components.

### External-Force Torque

An external force acting at a distance from the joint axis creates torque:

`T_external = F × r`

where `F` is the external force and `r` is the perpendicular lever arm.

### Preliminary Total

A preliminary requirement should include gravity, acceleration, external forces, friction and mechanism losses. These equations are screening tools only. Flexible structures, impact, control behavior, load sharing and multi-axis dynamics may require a more complete model.

## Step 3: Separate Continuous and Peak Torque

Continuous torque and peak torque are not interchangeable.

### Continuous Torque

Continuous torque must cover sustained motion, repeated cycles and holding conditions without exceeding the approved thermal limits of the selected motor, gearbox and driver configuration.

### Peak Torque

Peak torque is used for short events such as acceleration, disturbance recovery, impact response or starting under load. Specify:

- Required peak torque
- Peak duration
- Frequency of peak events
- Time between peaks
- Controller current limit
- Battery or bus voltage
- Cooling and ambient conditions

Never treat a published peak-torque value as a continuous rating.

## Step 4: Define Speed and the Complete Motion Cycle

Provide:

- Rated output speed
- Maximum output speed
- Acceleration and deceleration
- Travel angle
- Cycle time
- Holding time
- Rest time
- Direction-reversal frequency

Mechanical output power at an operating point is related to torque and angular speed:

`P = T × omega`

Torque and speed must be checked at the same operating point. A product's maximum torque and maximum speed may not be available simultaneously.

## Step 5: Establish the Installation Envelope

Define the maximum:

- Outer diameter
- Axial thickness
- Total length
- Weight
- Cable and connector space
- Driver-board space
- Brake space
- Mounting-flange envelope

Include the complete installed assembly, not only the reducer body. Bearings, output interfaces, covers, connectors and cable bend radius can consume significant space.

## Step 6: Review Radial, Axial and Overturning Loads

Output torque alone does not describe the structural load on a robot joint.

Provide:

- Radial load
- Axial load
- Overturning moment
- Load direction
- Distance from the load to the output bearing
- Impact or shock conditions
- Customer-side bearing arrangement

The output bearing and housing must be evaluated together with the robot structure. An external bearing or additional support may be required when the joint has a large cantilevered load or overturning moment.

## Step 7: Define Positioning and Mechanical Behavior

Specify the completed-axis targets for:

- Backlash
- Positioning accuracy
- Repeatability
- Angular resolution
- Stiffness or compliance
- Backdrivability
- Holding behavior
- Direction-reversal response

Gearbox backlash is only one part of joint behavior. Encoder position, bearing clearance, housing stiffness, link compliance, assembly tolerances and controller tuning also affect the result.

## Step 8: Choose a Transmission and Product Architecture

SigGear publishes both planetary joint actuators and cycloidal joint modules. Neither transmission type should be selected from a general rule alone.

### Planetary Joint Actuators

Planetary joint actuators may be evaluated when their published torque, speed, dimensions and configuration fit the application. SigGear's published planetary joint-actuator range includes SG-6010C, SG-6010D and SG-8021.

### Cycloidal Joint Modules

Cycloidal joint modules may be evaluated when the selected model's torque, speed, installation and configuration match the axis requirement. SigGear's published range includes CPM-100-25, CPM-80-25 and CPM-78-39.

### Published Starting Points

| Model | Transmission | Rated torque | Peak torque | Rated output speed | Configuration note |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| [SG-6010C](../products/robot-joint-actuators/sg6010c.md) | Planetary | 6 Nm | 18 Nm | 310 rpm | Driver and encoder functions depend on selected configuration |
| [SG-6010D](../products/robot-joint-actuators/sg6010d.md) | Planetary | 16 Nm | 50 Nm | 100 rpm | Available with or without integrated driver |
| [SG-8021](../products/robot-joint-actuators/sg8021.md) | Planetary | 10 Nm | 30 Nm | 160 rpm | Driver and encoder functions depend on selected configuration |
| [CPM-100-25](../products/cycloidal-joint-modules/cpm100-25.md) | Cycloidal pinwheel | 25 Nm | 75 Nm | 60 rpm | Available with or without integrated driver |
| [CPM-80-25](../products/cycloidal-joint-modules/cpm80-25.md) | Cycloidal pinwheel | 10 Nm | 50 Nm | 120 rpm | Available with or without integrated driver |
| [CPM-78-39](../products/cycloidal-joint-modules/cpm78-39.md) | Cycloidal pinwheel | 20 Nm | 52 Nm | 48 rpm | Standard catalog configuration uses Hall sensors and has no integrated-driver claim |

The table is a preliminary shortlist only. Dimensions, weight, external-load capacity, thermal behavior and control configuration must also be checked.

## Step 9: Define Encoder, Driver and Communication Requirements

Confirm whether the project requires:

- Motor commutation feedback
- Output absolute position
- Incremental or absolute encoder
- Position control
- Velocity control
- Torque or current control
- CAN
- RS485
- EtherCAT or another project-specific interface
- External controller or integrated driver
- Required communication rate and protocol details

Driver, encoder, communication and closed-loop functions are model- and configuration-specific. Do not assume that every actuator includes the same electronics.

CPM-78-39 must be treated separately: its standard catalog configuration uses Hall sensors and does not support a general claim of an integrated driver or absolute encoder.

## Step 10: Review Voltage, Current and Power Architecture

Specify:

- Nominal bus voltage
- Minimum and maximum bus voltage
- Continuous current limit
- Peak current limit and duration
- Battery or power-supply capability
- Regenerative-energy handling
- Emergency-stop behavior
- Cable and connector current capacity

The controller current limit directly affects available torque. Electrical limits must be checked together with the motor, thermal design and duty cycle.

## Step 11: Evaluate Thermal Conditions and Duty Cycle

Provide:

- Ambient temperature
- Operating time
- Holding time
- Rest time
- Cycle frequency
- Enclosure and mounting material
- Cooling method
- Airflow or conduction path
- Nearby heat sources

A joint mounted inside a sealed limb or compact housing may behave differently from the same actuator tested in open air. Prototype testing should reproduce the planned installation and motion cycle.

## Step 12: Define Brake, Safety and Power-Off Behavior

For gravity-loaded, wearable or safety-related axes, specify:

- Whether the joint may move when power is removed
- Required holding torque
- Mechanical brake requirement
- Emergency-stop behavior
- Manual release requirement
- Safe direction of motion
- Collision or overload strategy

A brake must not be assumed to be included unless it is explicitly confirmed in the selected configuration and quotation.

## Step 13: Plan Prototype Validation

Prototype testing should include representative:

- Payload and link geometry
- Continuous motion cycles
- Peak events
- Temperature monitoring
- Holding conditions
- Direction reversals
- Encoder behavior
- Controller current limits
- Communication behavior
- External loads
- Power-off and emergency-stop cases

Selection is complete only after the actuator is validated in the actual or representative mechanism.
